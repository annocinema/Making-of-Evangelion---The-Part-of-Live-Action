2
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:18,862
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Today was the day to watch Tiga on TV.

3
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,478
Take a pose, please.

4
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,771
It's a wide angle.

5
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,888
January 19

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,239
Special Production Crew - First Shoot Day

7
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,888
Writer, Director, and

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,668
Location Scenery Filming, etc

9
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:58,142
Hideaki Anno

10
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,130
Scene 48C Asuka's Commute

11
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:25,620
Soryu Asuka Langley / Yuko Miyamura

12
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,333
Action

13
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:38,738
Let's retake. Let's do it again.

14
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:43,880
Action

15
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,225
January 22

16
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:14,125
Matsumoto city, Nagano prefecture

17
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:18,289
Koufu city, Yamanashi prefecture

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Anno-san, weren't you pretty quiet the first day?

20
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:27,597
Yeah.

22
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,730
Were you respecting the staff there?

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think so and,

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,426
I was interested in how they make the film

25
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,590
because it's not my field and,

26
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:44,959
I was wondering how Higuchi makes films?

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,613
My curiosity was way bigger.

28
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,000
Everyone pretty expected something would happen.

29
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:52,474
Well it was the first day so I was quiet.

30
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,710
We were expecting you to do something.

31
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,312
Anno-san doesn't go crazy.

32
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,364
I was expecting more like...

33
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,965
I'm sorry for making you disappointed.

34
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:09,530
So when I received word that you broke down after the shoot,

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,709
I was like "Damn, how could I miss that!"
-I see.

37
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:15,995
When I see the shooting as an observer, it makes me want more cuts.

38
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,414
Ah, cutting?

39
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:18,415
Right.

40
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:20,442
Yeah I know. You're right, but...

41
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:22,000
I understand.

42
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,907
In the case of animation, you have a storyboard at the beginning.

43
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,500
Then you figure out how you can make it closer to that.

44
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:32,587
That's how we make it.

45
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:36,000
So I have a specific vision in my mind at the beginning.

46
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:40,978
If I'm faced with a situation like "now what will you do?"

47
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,090
my thoughts get a mess with a bunch of desires.

48
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:49,460
This is how I felt when I saw it as an observer.

49
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:59,537
January 23

50
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:07,000
Scene 48 Tokyo-2, full view, morning

51
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,324
Scene 48A The profile of the town, morning

52
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:38,000
No. You're not normal if you call yourself a normal person.

53
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:39,975
January 25

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,531
Because you have a desire to feel that you're normal,

55
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:45,545
at this point it's clear that you're not normal.

56
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,572
A normal person never insists he's normal.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,975
Either that, or you confess that you're a weirdo

58
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:53,371
before someone points out, like Nanri-san.

59
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,292
You confess before someone points out.

60
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:56,219
Then you can get a get-out-of-jail-free card in advance.

61
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:58,000
It's one of the patterns.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Scene 44 Asuka's room and

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well your hair,

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Scene 45 6 sqm studio apartment, in the morning

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Your hair should be more usual and messy.

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,970
You're defenseless.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You don't care how you look.

68
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's start with that.

69
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,575
Action

70
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,000
Baka Touji.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,572
Ah right, I went to a bar after work and then slept with him.

72
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:37,148
I'm bored of ending up with this.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,502
Touji Suzuhara / Tomokazu Semi

74
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,406
Are you changing the line with every take?

75
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,987
Sorry, I changed it just now.

76
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's make a good film.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,351
This light is on.

78
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:07,826
I'm going to give it my best shot.
I'm Shinnosuke (an anime character).

79
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,000
You're hiding this light?

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,794
Yeah, this light...

81
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:14,973
Let's go for it.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,124
...is annoying.

83
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:18,000
Go for it.
-Yes.

84
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm betting on it.

85
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,051
Let's make a good film.

86
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:23,683
I'm counting on you.

87
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,975
Can we move on to the test shots?
-Okay.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Scene 46 The bathroom in the morning

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Then, how about I act like this?

90
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,141
Yes.

91
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:37,349
I know...

92
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,789
he faked it.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,307
No. I can't believe he faked it.

94
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:48,000
I know it's just a half-way measure.

95
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:51,945
It takes time if you want to do something unique.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,961
But it's still faster than the animation.

97
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:59,000
Once you start taking pictures, it's faster.

98
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:03,722
This is why live-action takes only one or two weeks.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,034
It was hard for people to believe that I made an animation in a week. They said it must have been fast and sloppy.

100
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,900
Scene 49A Office

101
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,952
What will you do about this?
I keep wearing this on, right?

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,500
Sure. Right.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Rei Ayanami / Megumi Hayashibara

104
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,000
We're going to page 13?

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I got it.

107
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,939
Oops, I'm not supposed to open it.

108
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,341
Don't open it.

109
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:43,960
To try montage, can we cut some scenes off?

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think it's possible.

111
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:46,401
We cut some again.

112
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:49,000
I think there's no problems.

113
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:51,440
Huh?

114
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,675
This is a wide converter lens.

115
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,534
Is this?

116
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:54,515
Yeah.

117
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,621
"Do you want to be one with me?"

118
00:07:55,663 --> 00:07:57,190
You got that right.

119
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:11,968
Do you need to film seriously?

120
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,000
You don't?

121
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,954
Let's move on to the test shots.
-Okay.

122
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:24,932
Do you like feeling mellow, Anno san?

123
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:27,332
Hmm, do I like feeling mellow?

124
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,300
Yeah I think I like it.

125
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:30,701
Ah, you do.

126
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,630
Yeah.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well I seldom feel happy.

128
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,298
It's a low probability.

129
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:42,769
Then you don't seek happiness greedily.

130
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:44,626
Probably not.

131
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:47,620
I'm pretty happy most of the time.

132
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm jealous of that.

133
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:59,975
For example, food, clothing, hobbies

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,846
or whatever can make me feel happy.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,491
Quite simply, I can say I'm happy.

136
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:16,495
You know, that's a good thing.

137
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:17,355
You think so?

138
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:18,613
I do.

139
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:20,215
I think it's important.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Thanks.

141
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm very jealous that you have something like that.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't have any of that.

143
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,000
I take the bad side of everything basically.

144
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Oh, I see.

145
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,135
Do you think you have a bad habit of doing that?

146
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:42,794
Yes. Well, so as to avoid getting hurt later.

147
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,144
You feel safer.

148
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,000
You got it, I get hurt less deeply.
-I see.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,119
I have to force myself to take the bad side from the beginning.

150
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:55,756
Otherwise, I tend to expect a good thing automatically.

151
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:58,000
So my emotions rise or get too excited very easily.

152
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:01,899
Since I know that, I try to be calm as much as possible.

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Good morning.

154
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:07,502
Good morning.

155
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,000
I see.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,975
But you can't be happy if you aren't open to the opportunity to be happy.

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Only if you try to catch the opportunity proactively.

158
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,399
You need to ask.

159
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:29,992
"Ask, and it shall be given to you."

160
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:45,401
But there are a lot of people who get their energy from adverse circumstances, so it's hard to say for sure.

161
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,614
I like happiness.

162
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:52,487
Well, if I was surrounded by happiness, I wouldn't be doing this job.

163
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,565
I see.

164
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:05,554
(Mumbling lines)

165
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:08,179
I can't keep them in my brain.

166
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,200
January 26

167
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,371
Scene 48C: Asuka's commute

168
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:18,773
You know, I see a tight facial expression on her face.

169
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:21,000
She must feel cold.

170
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:32,556
Well I don't know, you're feeling like "I can't believe that old hag did this to me! I'm late for work now!"

171
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:36,446
Well it's about that kind of feeling.

172
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,436
You can tighten your lips or…you know...

173
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay, I'll try that.

174
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:43,860
It's better if you have some facial expression.

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like a sour face.

176
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:50,501
Exactly. Especially in the second half. Try it in the second half of the cut.

177
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:53,000
It's getting a bit of a forced rendering.

178
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,359
That's how it goes.

179
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,238
That's just the way it is.

180
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,269
Well, take it easy. You can sing a song.

181
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,000
Excuse me, I need to get through there.

182
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:24,647
Excuse me, I'm sorry I need to get through there.

183
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:26,860
I'm sorry for bothering you.

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Do you mind if I set the face out of the center?
-Not at all.

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What?
-She's playing a trick on you.

186
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,146
Let's take it out.

187
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh no, you can't do that.

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why not?

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I haven't slept at all.

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, I'm sleeping like three hours.

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm kinda sleeping.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That doesn't count as sleep.

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Scene 50 Evening

194
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,480
March 14

195
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,535
NGE: Death & Rebirth
Opening Night

196
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,671
Special Effects Team. Filming Continues.

197
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:50,963
Too many people.

198
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,837
NGE: Death & Rebirth
Screening

199
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,208
So let's bring in the voice actors,

200
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,603
our guests for today

201
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:08,300
Please give a big round of applause.

202
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:13,831
Good morning everyone.
-Good morning!

203
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:16,734
Greeting by voice actors from the stage

204
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:20,717
I'm Emi Ogata voice acting of Shinji Ikari.

205
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Thank you all for coming to the theater in the early morning despite the rain.

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,657
How did you like it?

207
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,384
Around 2 months later

208
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,815
May 8

209
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,890
Actually I don't know, either.

210
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
What do you think?

211
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,197
I think it's Evangelion.

212
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:12,098
What's that?

213
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:13,402
Anime.

214
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Please go ahead.

215
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:29,889
May 10

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,750
Special Effects Team. Last day of shooting.

218
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,966
July 19

219
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,975
The End of Evangelion
Released

220
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,400
Once again, January 22, Night.

221
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,400
When I saw the finished product, I finally realized that live action is live action after all.

222
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,000
Right.

223
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, it's live action!

224
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't get it.

225
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:07,734
Well, in short, it's a movie film.

226
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:13,000
It's pretty obvious, but that's my first impression of the film.

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,734
I felt it turned out to be a rather ordinary film.

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,710
I was feeling down but Higuchi's encouragement yesterday cheered me up a bit.

229
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,226
So now I'm thinking of a new script.
